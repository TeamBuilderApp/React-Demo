//Functional components are generally more concise and easier to read and understand, especially for simpler components.
//Hooks (like useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.) provide a way to add state and lifecycle features to functional components, eliminating the need for class-based lifecycle methods and this binding issues.
//In some cases, functional components with Hooks can lead to slightly better performance due to reduced overhead compared to class components.
//Functional components are often easier to test as they are pure functions (or can be easily made so with Hooks).
//While class components are still supported and valid, functional components with Hooks are the recommended and dominant pattern in modern React development..
